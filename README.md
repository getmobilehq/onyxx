## üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Tenancy & Security

### Data Isolation
- Organization-based data segregation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Tenant-scoped API endpoints

### Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure file upload handling

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users and Organizations
users (id, email, name, role, org_id, created_at)
organizations (id, name, subscription, created_at)

-- Building Management
buildings (id, name, type, address, year_built, square_footage, cost_per_sqft, org_id)
building_images (id, building_id, image_url, created_at)

-- Assessment System
assessments (id, building_id, type, status, assigned_to_user_id, notes, org_id)
building_elements (id, name, category, useful_life, install_year, org_id)

-- Advanced Features
report_subscriptions (id, user_id, frequency, report_type, filters, is_active)
```

### Key Relationships
- All tables include org_id for multi-tenancy
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps

---

## üìä FCI Calculation Engine

### Formula Implementation
```typescript
FCI = Total Repair Cost √∑ Replacement Value
Replacement Value = cost_per_sqft √ó square_footage
```

### Rating Scale
- **Excellent (0.00-0.1):** Representative of new building, routine maintenance only
- **Good (0.1-0.4):** Light investment needed, continue preventive maintenance
- **Fair (0.4-0.7):** Need strong plan for renovation
- **Critical (0.7+):** Consider demolition as cost of repair/replacement is at or close to 100% of new build

### Advanced Analytics
- Trend analysis over time
- Component-specific breakdowns
- Cost impact projections
- Maintenance optimization recommendations
