## 🔄 Complete Workflow Journey

### 1. Building Creation & Setup
```
User Action: Create new building
├── Input: Name, type, address, size, year built
├── System: Auto-calculate replacement value based on building type
├── Storage: Save to buildings table with organization scope
└── Result: Building ready for assessment
```

### 2. Assessment Initialization  
```
User Action: Start new assessment for building
├── Selection: Choose assessment type (pre-assessment/field assessment)
├── Assignment: Assign team members and set schedule  
├── System: Create assessment record with pending status
└── Result: Assessment workflow initiated
```

### 3. Pre-Assessment Planning
```
User Action: Complete pre-assessment checklist
├── Checklist: 8 mandatory items (plans, access, safety, etc.)
├── Elements: Select building systems to evaluate (Uniformat II)
├── Scope: Define assessment boundaries and objectives
└── Result: Field assessment ready to begin
```

**Pre-Assessment Checklist:**
- 🏗️ Building Plans and Drawings

### 4. Field Assessment Execution
```
User Action: Evaluate each building element on-site
├── Rating: Condition score 1-5 for each element
├── Documentation: Photos, notes, deficiency details
├── Categorization: Assign deficiencies to priority categories
├── Costing: Estimate repair costs for each deficiency
└── Result: Comprehensive element-by-element evaluation
```

**Condition Rating Scale:**
- **5 (New)**: No deficiencies, recently constructed/renovated
- **4 (Good)**: Minor deficiencies, routine maintenance needed
- **3 (Fair)**: Some deficiencies, planned maintenance required
- **2 (Poor)**: Major deficiencies, significant repairs needed  
- **1 (Critical)**: Severe deficiencies, immediate attention required

**Deficiency Categories:**
1. **Life Safety & Code Compliance**: Fire safety, structural integrity
2. **Critical Systems**: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, elevators
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Insulation, windows, lighting, controls
4. **Asset Life Cycle**: Roofing, flooring, equipment replacement
5. **User Experience**: Aesthetics, comfort, functionality
6. **Equity & Accessibility**: ADA compliance, universal design

### 5. Assessment Completion & FCI Calculation
```
System Process: Automatic calculation upon completion
├── Aggregation: Sum all repair costs by category
├── FCI Formula: Total Repair Cost ÷ Replacement Value
├── Interpretation: Apply industry standard FCI ranges
├── Storage: Update assessment with calculated FCI score
└── Result: Completed assessment with industry-standard metrics
```

**FCI Interpretation Ranges:**
- **0.00-0.10 (Excellent)**: New building, minimal investment needed
- **0.10-0.40 (Good)**: Light maintenance investment required  
- **0.40-0.70 (Fair)**: Renovation needed, significant investment
- **0.70+ (Critical)**: Consider replacement, major investment required

2. **Executive Summary**: Key findings, condition rating, investment priorities
3. **Building Information**: Detailed property specifications and metadata
4. **Assessment Methodology**: FCI calculation explanation and standards
5. **System Condition Analysis**: Element-by-element evaluation results
6. **Deficiency Summary**: Categorized issues with cost implications
