### Core Application Structure

- **Context-based State Management**: Authentication (`auth-context.tsx`) and organization (`org-context.tsx`) contexts provide global state
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Organization-scoped data access with role-based permissions (admin, manager, assessor). All database queries must filter by `org_id` to ensure tenant isolation
- **Layout System**: Separate layouts for authentication (`auth-layout.tsx`) and dashboard (`dashboard-layout.tsx`) views
- **ShadCN UI Components**: Comprehensive component library in `src/components/ui/` following Radix UI patterns
- **Backend Architecture**: Express app defined in `backend/src/app.ts`, server entry in `backend/src/server.ts`. Routes are modular and located in `backend/src/routes/`, controllers in `backend/src/controllers/`, services in `backend/src/services/`
- **Middleware Stack**: Authentication (`auth.middleware.ts`), error handling (`error.middleware.ts`), security (`security.middleware.ts`), file upload (`upload.middleware.ts`)
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL connection via `backend/src/config/database.ts`. Custom migration system in `backend/src/database/migrate.ts`

### Implemented Features

2. **Buildings Management**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Building listing with search and filtering
   - Building details pages with assessment history
   - Form validation with Zod schemas

3. **Assessment System**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Two-phase assessment workflow implemented

     - 0.00-0.1: Excellent (new building)
     - 0.1-0.4: Good (light investment)
     - 0.4-0.7: Fair (renovation needed)
     - 0.7+: Critical (consider demolition)
