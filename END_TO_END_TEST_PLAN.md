   - Add deficiencies with:
     - Description
     - Cost estimation
     - Category selection
     - Severity level
     - Photos (optional)
   - Add element notes
   - Save progress continuously

4. **Assessment Completion**
   - Complete all element assessments
   - Review FCI calculation
   - Finalize assessment
   - Verify data persistence

**Expected Result**: ✅ Complete assessment workflow functions

### 4. Report Generation and Management
**Objective**: Test report system integration

#### Test Steps:
1. **Automatic Report Generation**
   - Complete an assessment
   - Verify report auto-generation
   - Check report data accuracy
   - Confirm FCI calculations

2. **Report Viewing**
   - Navigate to `/reports`
   - View reports list
   - Apply filters (status, FCI range)
   - Search reports
   - Sort by different criteria

3. **Report Details**
   - Open specific report
   - Review all sections:
     - Executive Summary
     - FCI Analysis
     - System Conditions
     - Cost Breakdown
     - Recommendations

4. **PDF Export**
   - Click "Download PDF"
   - Verify PDF generation
   - Check PDF content accuracy
   - Test download functionality

**Expected Result**: ✅ Complete report system works

### 5. Data Integration Tests
**Objective**: Verify data consistency across the platform

#### Test Steps:
1. **Cross-Module Data Flow**
   - Create building → appears in assessments dropdown
   - Complete assessment → generates report
   - Edit building → updates related assessments
   - Delete validation works (can't delete building with assessments)

2. **Database Integrity**
   - All foreign key relationships maintained
   - Cascade deletes work correctly
   - Data migrations preserved existing data
   - FCI calculations are accurate

3. **API Integration**
   - Frontend successfully calls all backend APIs
   - Error handling works across all endpoints
   - Loading states display correctly
   - Success/error messages appear

**Expected Result**: ✅ All integrations work seamlessly
