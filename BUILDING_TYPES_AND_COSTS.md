# ONYX SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

## Default Cost Assignment Logic

```javascript
const buildingCostMap = {
  'healthcare': 350,
  'hospitality': 250,
  'educational': 220,
  'office': 200,
  'retail': 180,
  'mixed_use': 175,
  'residential': 150,
  'industrial': 120,
  'warehouse': 100
};

// Default fallback cost if type not specified
const DEFAULT_COST_PER_SQFT = 150;
```

## Replacement Value Calculation

```
Replacement Value = Square Footage × Cost Per SqFt × Regional Modifier
```

Example:
- 50,000 sq ft office building in Chicago
- Base cost: $200/sqft  
- Regional modifier: 1.15x
- **Total Replacement Value**: 50,000 × $200 × 1.15 = **$11,500,000**
