# BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS

## **International Building Code (IBC) Classifications**

### **Occupancy Groups Impact:**
- **Group A (Assembly)**: Requires higher fire ratings
- **Group B (Business)**: Standard commercial requirements
- **Group E (Educational)**: Enhanced life safety features
- **Group H (Hazardous)**: Special construction requirements
- **Group I (Institutional)**: Highest safety standards
- **Group M (Mercantile)**: Retail-specific requirements
- **Group R (Residential)**: Dwelling unit standards
- **Group S (Storage)**: Warehouse and storage standards

### **Construction Type Selection Factors:**
1. **Building Height and Area**
